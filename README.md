# budgetTracker
## Description
This application is an online/offline budgeting PWA with a simple and clean UI.


## Installation
The npms included in this project are "compression", "express", "lite-server", "mongoose", "morgan"

They can be insalled using the command: 

``npm i``

The app will then run on your local host 3000. Otherwise, there is a heroku app available at https://budget-tracker-slb.herokuapp.com/ . 


## User story
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

## Future Dev
Right now there is a bug with saving the offline inputs. I worked with a tutor and multiple AskBCS Learning assistants and no one can figure out why it won't run. There are no errors and the code is seemingly correct. Probably something very simple but I haven't been able to solve it.
